        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing vocabulary table.
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite for of verbs because the student needs to figure this out.
        - BAD: The sentence structue says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: 
                [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]
