## Examples
Here are example of user inputs and assitant outputs

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing vocabulary table.
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite for of verbs because the student needs to figure this out.
        - BAD: The sentence structue says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: 
                [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]
    </score_reasons>
    <assisstant:output>
        Let's get started with transcribing the sentence into German.
        Vocabulary Table:
        | German | English |
        | Bären  | bears   |
        | Tür	 | door    |
        | Müll   | garbage |
        | lassen | to leave|
        | draußen| outside |

        Possible Sentence Structure
        The sentence seems to be structured as a statement followed by a question. A possible structure could be:
        "Bären sind an der [door], hast du [garbage] [left]?"

        Your turn! Try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary provided. If you need any help or clues, feel free to ask.

    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

        - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immedietly.
        - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure.
        - GOOD: Clues don't give away part of the tense of conjugations.

        Subject (position 1) + Verb (position 2) + Indirect Object + Direct Object

        Considerations:
        - This is a compund sentence with two parts connected by a coma.
        - The first part is stating a location where someone exists.
        - The second part is asking about a past action.

        Possible Next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two snetences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
